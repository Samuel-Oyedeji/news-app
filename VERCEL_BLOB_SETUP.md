# Vercel Blob Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Vercel Blob for your project. This will allow you to store the images generated by the `fetch-news` API and receive a public URL for them.

## Step 1: Create a Blob Store in Vercel

1.  Go to your project's dashboard on Vercel.
2.  Click on the **Storage** tab.
3.  Click the **Create Database** button and select **Blob**.
4.  Give your Blob store a name (e.g., `news-images`) and select the region closest to your users.
5.  Click **Create**.

## Step 2: Link Your Project

1.  After the Blob store is created, you will be prompted to link it to your project.
2.  Select your project from the dropdown menu and click **Link**.
3.  Vercel will automatically add the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable to your project. This is all you need to connect to the Blob store.

## Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

To use Vercel Blob in your local development environment, you will need to pull the environment variables down to your local machine.

1.  Make sure you have the Vercel CLI installed:

    ```bash
    npm i -g vercel
    ```

2.  Log in to your Vercel account:

    ```bash
    vercel login
    ```

3.  Link your local project to the Vercel project:

    ```bash
    vercel link
    ```

4.  Pull the environment variables:

    ```bash
    vercel env pull .env.development.local
    ```

This will create a `.env.development.local` file in your project with the necessary `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`.

That's it! Your project is now configured to use Vercel Blob.
